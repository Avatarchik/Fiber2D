 Scheduler is responsible for triggering scheduled callbacks. All scheduled and timed events should use this class, rather than NSTimer.
 Generally, you interface with the scheduler by using the "schedule"/"scheduleBlock" methods in Node. You may need to aess Scheduler
 in order to aess read-only time properties or to adjust the time scale.
