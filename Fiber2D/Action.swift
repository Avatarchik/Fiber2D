/**
 Abstract base class for actions that (can) have a duration or can be reversed.
 
 Not all actions support reversing. See individual class references to find out if a certain action does not support reversing.
 
 ### Subclasses
 
 The ActionFiniteTime class has two additional subclasses (also abstract) which contain more information about actions
 that run instantly (completed within the same frame) vs. actions that run over time (typically taking more than a frame to complete).
 
 - ActionInstant
 - ActionInterval

/**
 Abstract base class for interval actions. An interval action is an action that performs its task over a certain period of time.
 
 Most ActionInterval actions can be reversed or have their speed altered via the ActionSpeed action.

 ### Repeating and Reversing Actions
 
 - Repeating an action a specific number of times:

 ### Creating Sequences of Actions
 
 - Creating a linear sequence of actions:
 - ActionSequence
 - Wait for a given time in a ActionSequence:
 - ActionDelay
 - Spawning parallel running actions in a ActionSequence and continue the sequence when all spawned actions have ended:
 - ActionSpawn
 
 ### Easing the Duration of an Action
 
 - Easing duration of a ActionInterval:
 - ActionEase
 - ActionEaseBackIn, ActionEaseBackInOut, ActionEaseBackOut
 - ActionEaseBounce, ActionEaseBounceIn, ActionEaseBounceInOut, ActionEaseBounceOut
 - ActionEaseElastic, ActionEaseElasticIn, ActionEaseElasticInOut, ActionEaseElasticOut
 - ActionEaseRate, ActionEaseIn, ActionEaseInOut, ActionEaseOut
 - ActionEaseSineIn, ActionEaseSineInOut, ActionEaseSineOut
 
 ### Animating custom float/double Properties
 
 - Tweening any node property (of type float or double):
 - ActionTween

// MARK: - ActionSpeed
/**
 Allows you to change the speed of an action while the action is running. Useful to simulate slow motion or fast forward effects.
 Can also be used to implement custom easing effects without having to create your own ActionEase subclass.
 
 You will need to keep a reference to the speed action in order to change its `speed` property. It is best to assign
 the speed action to an ivar or property with the `__weak` (ivar) or `weak` (@property) keyword.
 
 For instance:
 
 @implementation YourClass
 {
 __weak ActionSpeed* _speed;
 }
 
 Now you can create an action whose speed you want to be able to alter while the action is running:
 
 id move = [MoveBy actionWithDuration:60 position:p(600, 0)];
 _speed = [ActionSpeed actionWithAction:move speed:1];
 
 The speed factor of 1 will start running the `move` action at its normal speed. Later when you determined that it's
 time to change the speed of the `move` action, just change the `_speed` action's `speed` property:
 
 -(void) update:(Time)deltaTime
 {
 if (slowMotionMode) {
 _speed.speed = 0.2f; // move at one fifth of the regular speed
 } else {
 _speed.speed = 1.0f; // move at regular speed
 }
 }
 
 When the move action has run to completion it will end and thanks to the `__weak` keyword and ARC the `_speed` ivar will
 automatically become `nil`.
 
 @note ActionSpeed can not be added to a ActionSequence because it does not inherit from ActionFiniteTime.
 It can however be used to control the speed of an entire ActionSequence.
